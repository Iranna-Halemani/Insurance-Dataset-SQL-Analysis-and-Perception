# Insurance-Dataset-SQL-Analysis-and-Perception

Hello fellow data enthusiasts!
I’m thrilled to share my latest project—a deep dive into the Insurance Dataset using SQL queries. In this project, I’ve explored insurance-related data, answered critical questions, and uncovered valuable Perceptions.

Project Overview:
Dataset: The Insurance Dataset contains information about policyholders, premiums, and risk factors.

Objective: My goal was to extract meaningful insights that could inform decision-making within the insurance industry.

Approach:
I tackled questions such as
“Count how many are ‘northwest’ insurance holders?”
“Add new column as HL_Charges where more than average charges should be categorized as HIGH and less than average charges should be categorized as LOW?”
“Find MAX of ‘charges’?” and “What is MAX of ‘charges’?”
etc.
I go-through key findings to enhance understanding.

Repository Contents:
SQL Queries: You’ll find a comprehensive set of SQL scripts that I used to analyze the dataset.
README: This document provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the queries, and detailed insights.
Feel free to explore the repository, run the queries, and share your thoughts! Let’s unravel the mysteries hidden in insurance data together!
